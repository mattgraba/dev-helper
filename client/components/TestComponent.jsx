Sure, I will assist you in creating the TestComponent in React. First, let's set up the project file structure. We'll use a commonly used structure for React projects.

The proposed file structure is:
src/
|--components/
   |--TestComponent/
      |--TestComponent.js
      |--TestComponent.test.js
      |--TestComponent.css
```
- The `src` directory is the root directory for our application code.
- Inside `src`, we have a `components` directory where our React components will live.
- Each component, in this case `TestComponent`, gets its own directory which includes the component's JavaScript file, test file, and CSS file.

Now, let's create the boilerplate code for each of these files.

1. TestComponent.js
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './TestComponent.css';

class TestComponent extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="test-component">
                {/* Component code goes here */}
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default TestComponent;
```
This file defines a new React component `TestComponent`. This component is a class that extends `React.Component`. It has a `render` method which returns what the component renders - in this case, a `div` with the class name `test-component`.

2. TestComponent.test.js
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import TestComponent from './TestComponent';

test('renders without crashing', () => {
  render(<TestComponent />);
});
```
This file contains a simple test that ensures the `TestComponent` can render without throwing. It uses functions from the `react-testing-library` to render the component and assert that it doesn't throw an error.

3. TestComponent.css
```css
.test-component {
    /* Component styles go here */
}
```
This file is where all the CSS styles for the `TestComponent` live. It's empty for now, but you can add styles as needed.
