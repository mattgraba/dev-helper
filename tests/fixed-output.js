Here's the corrected version of your code:

```javascript
// tests/sample-bug.js

function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

greet("Matthew");
  
```

In JavaScript, function parameters must be defined inside parentheses, which were missing in your original code. Also, every statement should ideally end with a semicolon.
