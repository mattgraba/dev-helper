# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Index

This folder tracks important decisions made during the development of **Dev Helper**.  
Each ADR documents the context, decision, alternatives, and consequences.  
Statuses may be **Accepted**, **Proposed**, or **Superseded**.

| 002   | Interface Choice (CLI-First vs IDE Plugin) | Accepted | CLI-first to align with four pillars, avoid vibe-coding. |

## ðŸ”‘ Usage
- New ADRs should follow incremental numbering (e.g., `009`, `010`).
- Each ADR file is stored in `docs/adrs/ADR-###-title.md`.
- Updates should **not delete old ADRs** â€” instead, mark them as **Superseded** if a decision is replaced.

---

## ðŸ§­ Philosophy Reminder
All ADRs must align with Dev Helperâ€™s **four pillars**:  
1. Empowering intentional usage  
2. Promoting critical thinking  
3. Augmenting fundamentals  
4. Resisting vibe-coding
