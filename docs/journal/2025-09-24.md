### Return to Dev Helper â†’ Wrapping up Web App MVP
#### Dev Helper Progress Summary (Preâ€“Web App MVP)
**âœ… Package Cleanup & Publishing**
- Refactored project structure to ensure only essential files are included in the npm package.
- Added a `.npmignore` and updated `files` in `package.json` to prevent shipping `node_modules` and unnecessary assets.
- Consolidated **dependencies** into the root `package.json` so client + server rely on the global install.
- Removed duplicate `node_modules` in client and server, keeping a single root dependency tree.
- Renamed package from `dev-helper-ai` â†’ `dev-helper` (scoped as `@mattgraba/dev-helper` on npm since `dev-helper` was locked).
- Successfully published to npm as:
```bash
npm install -g @mattgraba/dev-helper
```

**âœ… Documentation Overhaul**
- Completely revamped `README.md` to **portfolio-ready quality**:
    - Branded header with **npm version, MIT license, portfolio, GitHub, and LinkedIn badges**.
    - âœ¨ Features list.
    - ðŸ“¦ Installation instructions.
    - ðŸš€ Quick Start usage examples (login, analyze, generate, fix, history).
    - ðŸ§© CLI usage & architecture breakdown (command structure, available commands).
    - Context-aware mode documentation.
    - Architecture diagram (CLI â†’ API â†’ OpenAI â†’ MongoDB).
    - Auth + history storage sections.
    - ðŸ–¼ **Screenshots & Demo placeholders** (CLI, Login, Analyze & Fix, History).
    - ðŸ“ˆ Roadmap (Web UI polish, deployment, history filters, RBAC, AI context trimming).
    - ðŸ“œ License + professional footer with badges (Portfolio, GitHub, LinkedIn).

### Web App MVP Goals
Our frontend MVP should mirror the CLI's **core features** but in a polished, login-gated UI:
- **Login / Auth**: Token-based login to backend (`/login`), saving token in localStorage.
- **Error Input Form**: A textarea + file upload to send to `/analyze`.
- **History Page**: Fetches from `/history` with optional filters (user ID, date, etc.)
- **UI Polish**: Match our Framer/Tailwind design--headline/subheadline, About section, links to Github/portfolio

MVP flow looks like this:
1. User lands on homepage â†’ sees pitch & CTA to login
2. User logs in (JWT saved).
3. User can submit error/input in a simple form â†’ gets AI explanation + fix back.
4. User can click **History** â†’ see past interactions.

### Web App MVP Result
Makes project a true **full-stack SaaS demo.**:
- Backend API (Express + MongoDB).
- CLI interface (npm package, real distribution).
- Web frontend (React/Tailwind, JWT auth).
- Deployed MVP (Heroku/Vercel/Render).
